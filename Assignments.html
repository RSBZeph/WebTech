				<h2>Assignments</h2><br>

				<h3 id="Pong">Assignment 1: Pong</h3>
				<p>
					In the first assignment you will learn how to make the game pong. This will make you learn the basic of programming. 
					You will learn how to use variables, functions, classes and how monogame works. 
					We expect you to have implemented these features for a passing grade.
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Moving paddles and balls</li>
					<li>Bounce interactions of the ball with the wall and the paddles</li>
					<li>A scoring board and/or a live system</li>
					<li>A start and end screen</li>
				</ul>

				<p>
					You will get a higher grade for having clean code and/or for implementing new features in the game.
				</p>


				<h3 id="Tetris">Assignment 2: Tetris</h3>
				<p>
					In the second assignment you will learn how to make the game Tetris. Here we will go a little more indepth into programming.
					You will learn how to use every kind of loop, how arrays and lists work and we will be building on the fundamentals of Pong. 
					We expect you to have implemented these features for a passing grade.
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>A grid with falling blocks</li>
					<li>The seven standard blocks of tetris</li>
					<li>Being able to move the blocks and rotate them</li>
					<li>Being able to destroy blocks when they form a horizantal full line</li>
					<li>Seeing what the next block will be</li>
					<li>A scoring system</li>
					<li>The game must slowly becoming more difficult</li>
				</ul>

				<p>
					You will get a higher grade for having clean code and/or for implementing new features in the game.
				</p>


				<h3 id="TickTick">Assignment 3: TickTick</h3>
				<p>
					In the third assignment you will learn how to make the game TickTick. This is a platformer game just like Super Mario.
					we have already provided you a big part of the code and you will be adding more features to it.
					After this assignment you should be able too know your way around programming.
					You we use all the things you learned in the previous two assignment to compleet the assignment.
					We expect you to have implemented these features for a passing grade.
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Make the player able to kill enemies by jumping on their heads</li>
					<li>Implement a shooting feature</li>
					<li>The sceen must move with the player when it moves</li>
				</ul>

				<p>
					You will get a higher grade for having clean code and/or for implementing new features in the game.
