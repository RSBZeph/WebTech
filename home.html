				<h3>Course Goal:</h3>
				<p>The student knows the language constructions and the usual idiom of the imperative and object-oriented programming paradigms, and is therefore able to build a 2D game environment with sprites.</p>
				<h3>Course Matter:</h3>
				<p>In this course you learn to program games in the programming language C#, in which assignments are bundled in so-called methods that process an object. It is therefore also an introduction to object-oriented programming. C# is a modern programming language that is also used in game engines such as Unity3D. Switching to C++, still an important language in the game industry, is relatively easy. We look at how you change the memory, and how you program choice and repetition. You describe new types of objects with associated methods, but you are also introduced to the standard methods associated with C#. You also get to know the game loop, which is the basis of each game. Although you can develop full 3D games with C# and the accompanying game engine that we use, we focus on developing 2D games in the lecture. We will develop a number of different example games during the course, including a shooting game and a puzzle game. At the end of the course a full platform game is developed with graphics, sound and animation.</p>
				<p>In the common basis of game programming and the sister course Imperative Programming are discussed:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>the structuring of an OO program (classes, methods, objects, (re) definition)</li>
					<li>the most important assignment types (assignment, if, while, for, possibly switch and try)</li>
					<li>the most important forms of expression (constant, variable, call, operators, new, arrays)</li>
					<li>some program frameworks (event-driven, main with console I/O)</li>
					<li>elementary design patterns (search of minimum, building of results, peat, etc.)</li>
					<li>the basic data types (int, double, boolean, char, string, arrays)</li>
					<li>a number of important libraries (basic utilities, graphics, structure of user interfaces)</li>
					<li>de omgang met de ontwikkelomgeving</li>
				</ul>
				<p>In addition, Gameprogramming also discusses:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>the typical design of a 2D game</li>
					<li>the use of the MonoGame engine</li>
					<li>background, history and classics of game programming</li>
					<li>applications, in particular for creating interactive games</li>
				</ul>
